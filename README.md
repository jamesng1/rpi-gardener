## Calibrating the Moisture Sensor
To calibrate the moisture sensor wait until the plant needs watering and adjust the potentiometer until the light that signifies that there is no moisture just goes out. This light will go out again when it hits the same moisture level and therefore indicate the plant needs watering

# Running the Program
Before running the main method run ```sudo pigpiod```

# Writing to InfluxDB
Add to the influxdb.ini
